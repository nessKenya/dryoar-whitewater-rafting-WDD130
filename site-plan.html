      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p> The purpose of the White Water Rafting Company is to provide individuals with a lifetime adventure. This is achievable as we offer the best rafting expeditions providing individuals with full equipment and expert guides. The rafting trip takes place along the rivers winding their way through spectacular white water, clear rivers that are ideal for calm drifts through beautiful scenery. Things get even quite exciting if you own a kayak or raft of your own.
Also, we aim to help families have quality time together. We offer water rafting sports with our expert guides available to ensure the safety of your family. Give your little ones, an experience worth remembering in their entire life. </p>  <!-- change this -->

These include singles, families, students, and companies seeking to offer their staff with an offsite team-building experience. We offer individuals an opportunity to enjoy the spectacular scenery while rafting and viewing the game that includes beautiful birds. Our site will be responsive, and accessible through phones, tablets, and laptops. 
Additionally, we live in a technologically embraced period where our target audience who majorly are aged 18 to 50 depend heavily on their smartphones, tablets, and laptops in browsing the internet. We also consider schools seeking for places to take their high school students for an academic trip or vacation.  </p>  <!-- change this -->

        The Site Map of a site is just like it sounds…it is a map of the pages in a site and how they are related and linked together. From the map above we can see that we will eventually have the Home page and 2 sub or child pages.
      </p>  
      <p>
        The lines that connect them all together indicate that each page should be accessible from any other page, it is essentially showing us the global navigation for the site.
      </p>
      <!--
Choose your pages that you will create and put the names inside the two child page boxes… Some suggestions are below:

•	FAQ
•	Blog
•	Contact Us
•	Rivers We Run
•	Schedule/Rates/Dates -->

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Wireframes are like blueprints for making webpages.  They should show the major sections of content that will be on the page and the relative locations of each element.  In the wireframe below you can see there will be 6 sections to our page:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>At the top we have a section with the logo (the box with the mountain means an image) and the navigation bar.</li>
        <li>Then there is a banner image that stretches all the way across the screen.</li>
        <li>Next we have some text and an image </li>
        <li>...followed by another row made up of an image and some text.</li>
        <li>Then one more section of text with no image.</li>
        <li>Lastly, a footer containing a copyright/name line and 3  social media icons. </li>

      </ol>
