        I am Nelson Muchonji Bifwoli from Kenya. My interest is to become one of the leading web developers and programmer in the world. The aim is to use this opportunity and experience to encourage the rising generation that they too can achieve anything as long as they put their hearts into it. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I love listening to music or BYU devotionals. Additionally, I love reading my scriptures, especially the Book of Mormon. Currently, am reading all the general conference talks from 1972 and as well going through the discourses of The Prophet Joseph Smith.
      </p>
    
    <p>
      What about BYU Idaho is the opportunity to learn in an environment that promotes gospel learning. Currently under pathway am enrolled in Web Design and Development (WDD) course, which am happy to be in. My long time goal is to pursue a degree in Computer Information Technology.

    <h4>
      Why Taking a course in Web Design and Development (WDD)?
    </h4>
  
  
    <p>
      My greatest interest has always been in technology. Exploring a course in Web Design helps to be part of the future. Each day, everything is being transformed to depend on Technology. Today, there are rising eCommerce sites that help people do purchases online and even book appointments or place an order solely online. All these and many other transactions are happening on the web. 
    </p>
    <p>
      One of my life dreams is to start a business and train youths in web development so that they may have means to support themselves and their families. Taking this course, is a great priviledge to learn and in due time use the same knowledge to impact the rising generation.

      Moroni 10:32,
      "Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ; and if by the grace of God ye are perfect in Christ, ye can in nowise deny the power of God."
